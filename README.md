## dwm - Luvrok's build
inspired by [bread's build](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins/dwm), [bakkeby's dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch), [vanilla dwm](https://git.suckless.org/dwm/files.html) and [my own old dwm-flexipatch build](https://github.com/Luvrok/dwm-flexipatch).
